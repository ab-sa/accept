# accept
R package for the ACute COPD Exacerbation Prediction Tool (ACCEPT)

Please refer to the published paper for more information: 

Adibi A, Sin DD, Safari A, Jonhson KM, Aaron SD, FitzGerald JM, Sadatsafavi M. The Acute COPD Exacerbation Prediction Tool (ACCEPT): a modelling study. The Lancet Respiratory Medicine. Published Online First 2020 March 13th; [doi:10.1016/S2213-2600(19)30397-2](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600%2819%2930397-2/fulltext)

## Installation

The latest stable version can be downloaded from CRAN:  
`install.packages ('accept')`

Alternatively, you can download the latest development version from GitHub:

```
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("resplab/accept")
```

# Web App for ACCEPT 

ACCEPT is also available as web app, accessible at [http://resp.core.ubc.ca/ipress/accept](http://resp.core.ubc.ca/ipress/accept)

# ACCEPT in R

### Sample Data

To get started, there is an R data frame with the package of sample patient data. I have printed columns 1-13 and 14-19 separately because there isn't enough space:

```
library(accept)
samplePatients <- accept::samplePatients

```

### Exacerbation Prediction

To get a prediction for exacerbation rate, you will need to pass in a patient vector:

```
results <- predictACCEPT(samplePatients[1,])
print(t(results))
```

The **predictACCEPT()** function returns a data frame with the original patient data, along with the predictions for different treatment options. 

To visualize the data, there is a graphing function called **plotExacerbations()**, which creates a Plotly bar graph. You have the option of selecting **probability** or **rate** for which prediction you want to see, and either **CI** or **PI** to select the confidence interval or prediction interval respectively.

```
plotExacerbations(results, type="probability", interval = "CI")
```

```
plotExacerbations(results, type="probability", interval = "PI")
```

```
plotExacerbations(results, type="rate", interval = "CI")
```

### Probability of N Exacerbations (Poisson)

We can also calculate the predicted number of exacerbations in a year:

```
patientResults = predictACCEPT(samplePatients[1,])
exacerbationsMatrix = predictCountProb(patientResults, n = 10, shortened = TRUE)
print(exacerbationsMatrix)
```

The shortened parameter groups the probabilities from 3-10 exacerbations into one category, "3 or more exacerbations." To see all n exacerbation probabilities:

```
exacerbationsMatrix = predictCountProb(patientResults, n = 10, shortened = FALSE)
print(exacerbationsMatrix)
```

To visualize the matrix as a heatmap, we can use the function **plotHeatMap**:

```
plotHeatMap(patientResults, shortened = FALSE)
```

## Cloud-based API Access 

The [PRISM platform](http://prism.resp.core.ubc.ca) allows users to access ACCEPT through the cloud. A MACRO-enabled Excel-file can be used to interact with the model and see the results. To download the PRISM Excel template file for ACCEPT, please refer to the [PRISM model repository](http://resp.core.ubc.ca/ipress/prism).

#### Linux

In Ubuntu, you can call the API with `curl`:

```
curl \
-X POST \
-H "x-prism-auth-user: REPLACE_WITH_API_KEY" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"func":["prism_model_run"],"model_input":[{"ID": "10001","male": 1,"age": 57,"smoker": 0,"oxygen": 0,"statin": 0,"LAMA": 1,"LABA": 1,"ICS": 1,"FEV1": 51,"BMI": 18,"SGRQ": 63,"LastYrExacCount": 2,"LastYrSevExacCount": 1,"randomized_azithromycin": 0,"randomized_statin": 0,"randomized_LAMA": 0,"randomized_LABA": 0,"randomized_ICS": 0, "random_sampling_N" : 1000, "random_distribution_iteration" : 20000, "calculate_CIs" : "TRUE"}]}' \
